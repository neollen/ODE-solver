# ODE-solver

#This is a solver for Ordinary differential equation(C++&Wxwidgets), which implements two methods including exact solution and #finite difference.This project was built before I learned object oriented programming,so it does not have this kind of #thought,the main idea about this is to understand the basic program design.
